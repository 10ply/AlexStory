
	Once upon on a time there was a crocodile named Thomas. Thomas liked to build robots. One day, Thomas built a robot alligator.
This was a problem because robogator didn't sound nearly as cool as robocroc. If only there as a way to fix Thomas's problem....

	Thomas was in a very interesting predicament. However Thomas is the leader of a fierce crocidile pack and he decisions will not
be questioned. He proceeds with out worry of his creation until his leadership is questioned by a brave crocodile named Jaime. Jaime was 
only 3 years old but he was a strong crocodile. Jaime came out of the pack and challenged Thomas.
          
        Jaime and Thomas then proceeded to have a gladiator combat in the famous crocodile arena of the ancient Crocodalian Empire. 
        Jaime was a fierce opponent, but Thomas already had experienced with several weapons. Eventually Thomas prevailed and cast Jaime out to the shadowlands, a fate worse than death some would say.
	Robo-god of the Robouniverse saw this and disapproved of Thomas and his evil actions. Robo-god sent down a surge of robo-energy into Jaime and he was resurrected. He was given extrastrength and merged into the Robo-matrix where he had infinite knowledge and skill to defeat Thomas. Jaime was ready for the battle of the century.

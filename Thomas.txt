
	Once upon on a time there was a crocodile named Thomas. Thomas liked to build robots. One day, Thomas built a robot alligator.
This was a problem because robogator didn't sound nearly as cool as robocroc. If only there as a way to fix Thomas's problem....

	Thomas was in a very interesting predicament. However Thomas is the leader of a fierce crocidile pack and he decisions will not
be questioned. He proceeds with out worry of his creation until his leadership is questioned by a brave crocodile named Jaime. Jaime was 
only 3 years old but he was a strong crocodile. Jaime came out of the pack and challenged Thomas.
